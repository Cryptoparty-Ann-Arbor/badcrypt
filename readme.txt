this repo has some DIY encryption that I am cooking up all by my lonesome (unless you join in!) it's all educational and all pretty non-functional. Enjoy some C++!

smoke_hash.cpp:
this is a simple example, you could have a hashing scheme where you said a=1, b=2, etc
it would just be terribly obvious to a basic newspaper reader

it gets you thinking about what hashes are, just another way to represent a message that is not necessarily reversible
what gets tough is resistance to cryptoanalysis!

more to come later!
